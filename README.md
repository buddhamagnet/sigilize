CHAOS

This is a Go package designed to assist with the sigilization method of
magic designed by [Austin Osman Spare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Osman_Spare) and popularised by [chaos magic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_magic).

To create a sigil, write down your desire, remove all vowels and then remove
all repeated characters. Turn this into a sigil.

This package removes the grunt work and strips your words making them ready
for sigilization.
